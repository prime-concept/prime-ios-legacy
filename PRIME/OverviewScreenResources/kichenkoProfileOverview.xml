    content="I use PRIME concierge services quite often. Especially when it comes to traveling.&#10;&#10;PRIME has its secrets, they know how to find a flight to the desired location quickly. Thanks to PRIME, I repeatedly managed to get more comfortable rooms with the right view, discounts and other privileges. When I find time for a vacation, it is important for me to get that very category and layout, which I wanted or saw on the hotel website. My life principle is &quot;the devil is in the details&quot;.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, I have no problem with visiting the most difficult-to-access restaurants in the capital city. But I think that for those who have difficulties, chances of getting into a popular place increase significantly thanks to PRIME. In Moscow, by the way, there are not so many such places. But in Europe, it is really good to have such a &quot;spy&quot; that will always help to quickly and effectively solve one or another issue.&#10;&#10;Before the trip, I don’t forget to look in the City Guide by PRIME.&#10;Here you can find advice from opinion-makers, opinion leaders and influential people on the best restaurants, attractions, hotels, etc. I myself have repeatedly shared recommendations of the various cities with PRIME.&#10;There are always people whose taste you trust, and I’m glad that PRIME carries out this kind of polls. When you ask a question:&#10;&quot;Where to dine in Rome&quot; or &quot;What to see in Vienna&quot;, people advice, whose opinion you can rely on, is very helpful.">
